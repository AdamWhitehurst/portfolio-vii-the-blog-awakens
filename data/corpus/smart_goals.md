# Background
Recently I began working on a system for managing my learning and projects through [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) -- which I actually wired into this portfolio so my posts are automatically rendered into webpages, more on that in another post. 

Previously, I had managed my projects through [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), but I found that is wasn't robust enough for me as a developer who likes to have access to my own data. Being the JS, VS Code enthusiast I am, I felt immediately at home in the Obsidian community.

Obsidian gives me more freedom to manage my data the way I want to, but it has less features out-of-the-box. I find this to be a good thing because, in my opinion, too much hand-holding prevents people from actually grokking why project/learning management systems are structured the way they are. In the Notion community, I saw far too many complicated copy-and-paste management systems, of which you would only end up using half. Basically, building your management system is a necessary step of using the system in my opinion. **[If you do want to use Notion, I recommend following August Bradley's system, but don't just copy-paste his template, follow the videos so you learn why and how the system works.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAl0gPKnL3V8s7dPXoo07mYnuErhWVk8b)** I will be reviewing August Bradley's system (which I followed in Notion) for idea's in my Obsidian system.

# SMART Goals
This is a method for defining goals that are clearly defined and doable. SMART is an acronym for:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Relevant
- Timely

It should be apparent that this acronym outlines how to define a goal such that it is easy to complete; providing clear boundaries for what an atomic goal would look like. If a certain goal doesn't nicely fit inside these constraint, it probably needs to be dissected into multiple goals. Onto the details of each criterion.

## Specific
The less specific a goal, the more difficult it is to determine how long the goal should take or how to measure success. Take these three goals:
- "Get healthy"
- "Lose weight"
- "Lose ten pounds"

You can see how the last one is the most specific, and how it could fit into the next few criteria while the former goals will not.

## Measurable
Another way to put this is: "What determines the goal's success?" It could be a simple yes or no answer: "Climb to the top of a mountain" would be measured by: "Did you climb to the top of a mountain?" Yes or no. Additionally, you could use a metric such as: "Did you lose ten pounds?" 

## Attainable
How would the goal be achieved? In other words: What is the action plan? What are the resources and capabilities to achieve the success? What are you lacking? 

This criterion is usually the place where you determine whether to add more goals or break this goal into more atomic goals. For instance, if you want to lose ten pounds, but you don't have a scale to measure your weight, you would want to add another goal to: "Buy a scale."

Along with actionability, the 'A' stands for "ambitious". While it may be tempting to make numerous small tasks so you can quickly check many off, it is a lot like running on a treadmill: Going fast, but getting nowhere. If you need to buy a scale to measure your weight, would it really be useful to set goals such as: "Find keys", or "Drive to store?"

## Relevant
This one is a little tricky. In isolation, any goal could be relevant, but within the context of all your current goals, how do you monitor and prioritize all the goals you may have at one time?

One technique is to chart your goals on a graph of Effort to Value. Oftentimes, the low-effort, high-value goals are the most relevant.

Another technique you could use is the [[Pareto Principle]] by asking: "Which are the 20% of goals that would provide me 80% of my return?"

Similarly to the attainable / ambitious split, relevant shares it acronymity with "realistic." Following the same example for buying a scale, is a goal to "drive to the store" actually a goal, or just a necessary part of "buying a scale" (because, where else are you gonna buy a scale)? Make your goals realistic so you're not just adding fluff to your system.

## Timely
This goes hand-in-hand with measurability because adding a time-constraint makes a goal more measurable. Consider "losing ten pounds" vs. "losing ten pounds in ten weeks." The latter allows you to calculate how much weight you should be losing per week, thus it is more measurable than the former.

# Next Steps
From here, I will be turning this goal-planning startegy into templates for my Obsidian system, and then considering how I will organize these goals to make them easier to track. Stay tuned.
