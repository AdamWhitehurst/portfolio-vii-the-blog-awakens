## Focus On Quality and Quantity
- Your investments are the quantity of shares you have, NOT the dollar amount attached to them. 
- "Realizing gains" is really just "paying taxes" if all you're going to do with the money is reinvest it.
- "Buy Low, Sell High" mentality leads to emotionality with price fluctuation
- High conviction in a stock means that when the price dips, you see it as a SALE. Concurrently, it is also sad when the price goes up because then you can buy less. This is OKAY.
-  Be aware of [[hedonistic_adaptation]], the 'heavenly hottie' in this case. 
	-  New exciting investment opportunities will come up
	-  Remember, you only have so many investments you can make, so pick the BEST ones, not every next exciting one. 
	-  Everything heavenly becomes ordinary.
