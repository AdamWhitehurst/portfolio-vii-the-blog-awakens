---I spent a week (on and off) trying to get babel to transpile a node server so I could write modern JS. For some reason I had no luck and it seemed like everything I read was telling me to do what I'd done. So anyway, I started over today and it worked right away. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here's how I did it:

1. `npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/node`

2. `npm install --save-dev nodemon`

3. Create `.babelrc` file and inside: `{ "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"] }`

4. In `package.json`, under `"scripts"` add `"start": "nodemon --exec babel-node lib/index.js",`

5. `npm run start`
