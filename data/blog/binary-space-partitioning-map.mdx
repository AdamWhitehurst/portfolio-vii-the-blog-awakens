Today I added a map builder that uses [Binary Space Partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning) to create interior-type maps. This basically means the map is split in half over and over until some minimum dimension is reached, then all the rooms are connected.

I find the generation visualization so satisfying. More to come.
