# üí∞ The Elevator Pitch
What if we made a bet: Spend 10 minutes to increase both your happiness and focus by 1% for the day. Would you take that bet? Considering you probably waste 10 minutes laying in bed, sitting on the toilet, or just wandering about the house, I think anyone could spare 10 minutes from your day. 

This is what meditation does for you-- and 1% improvement is *the most conservative* measure I could use. If you were willing to take the 1% bet, how would you feel if it were 2%? 5%? 10%??

Now that I have piqued your interest, here's why I believe meditation can do this.

<br/>

# ‚ú® It's Not Woowoo Magic-Stuff
I get it. I've seen all those crazy-looking people talking about meditation like it will make you transcend reality to some higher plane of existence so you can talk to god(s).

This is not the same kind of meditation I'm talking about. There are many kinds of meditation, but I'm talking about mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness meditation is simply observing the way your mind behaves. You don't even have to sit cross-legged if you don't want üòè

<br/>

# üíÉ Practice Makes Perfect
Think about something in your life that you've gotten good at. I bet you know how practicing made you better at it. Now ask yourself: "How could I practice thinking better?" "How could I practice focusing better?" "How could I practice controlling my emotions better?"

Mindfulness Meditation. **Mindfulness meditation is the practice of understanding the way your mind behaves, which gives you the insight to operate it more efficiently.**

At its core, mindfulness meditation helps you understand what your 'monkey mind' is, or how your mind seeks stimulation via thoughts or feelings. Once you understand this, you start to hone the spotlight of your perception to tame your monkey mind. This allows you to disassociate from your impulses (thoughts, emotions, feelings) so that you can focus your mind on what you choose. If that sounds effortful or exhausting, it's not! Quite the opposite, it's more like gently guiding the monkey that is your mind.

# ü§î Where's the Evidence?
First, I want to say that, anecdotally, meditation makes sense because we are constantly overstimulating our brains with media and trying to multi-task, and that mindfulness meditation is the exact opposite of that: Focusing on one thing for an extended duration. So if you feel anxious or overwhelmed, meditation is a good countermeasure. Okay, but really, there's good science behind it.

Rebecca Gladding, a Psychiartrist at [Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior](https://www.doximity.com/pub/rebecca-gladding-md) explains how [parts of the brain can actually rewire themselves after extended meditation practice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/use-your-mind-change-your-brain/201305/is-your-brain-meditation). Gladding explains that regular meditation actually loosens the connections between vmPFC insula and the amygdala, implying that bodily sensations have less control on your reactions. In contrast, stronger connections between the dmPFC insula and the amygdala also form, implying that processing of information related to other people increases, i.e. more empathy. Great, correlation but not causation.

Moreover, [An MRI analysis of 20 participants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/) found 
> "Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls." This (small) study implies that there are physiologically visible effects of meditation, which seems to reinforce what Gladding claims.

Finally, [A small Massachusetts General Hospital study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/06/mindfulness-meditation-and-relaxation-response-affect-brain-differently/) investigated the difference between two types of meditation, mindfulness and relaxation-response: 

> "healthy adults with high levels of stress were randomized to two eight-week programs. Eighteen completed the relaxation-response program, and 16 completed the mindfulness program. Both programs successfully decreased stress and increased mindfulness in participants. However, the mindfulness program resulted in further improvements in measures such as self-compassion and rumination, clearly indicating that the programs are not the same ..." 

The lead author, Gunes Sevinc, conjectured that: 

> "The results showed that the strength of neural interaction between brain regions associated with present-moment awareness and bodily attention increased during both types of body-scan meditation. But each program also showed unique patterns of brain activity, in line with the different theoretical orientation of each program."
 
This implies that, given there seems to be some physiological effect of meditation on the brain, people also seem to perceive that effect as well.

I have tried hard to emphasize that this evidence is not totally conclusive. **Rather, I'm trying to convince you that there is something worth testing here.**

# ü§© Ready to Give it a Shot?
I highly recommend the [Headspace App ](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app) (I'm not sponsored, just a fan)

![[headspace.png]]

It has a free 10-day, 10-minute beginner course and I think that's all it will take for you to start noticing the difference. It's also a cheap membership once you are ready to keep going. I have taken the beginner course with Andy several times, paid for the membership and found the paid content to be exceptional as well. I cannot recommend it enough.

![Waking up logo](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbiohackstack.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F10%2Fwaking-up-app.png&f=1&nofb=1)

I have also tried the [Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/) app. I found it didn't have as great instruction about the basics of meditation. It seems more oriented toward people who wish to explore the mind and consciousness. I should also note that it may contain un-relaxing topics at times, such as politics. It is something I recommend if you already have a good grasp on the practice of mindfulness.

I firmly believe that, in today's society, practicing focus and working towards more empathy and well-being is essential. I have found meditation to be highly effective at doing this, and have also seen how the benefits go away after stopping the practice. It's not woowoo, and I only want to convince others because of the positive impact it has had on me. 

So if you're ready to start, just download the app and set a routine. I do it right after I work out, but the trick is to do it right after you do another habit, whether that's right after waking up, after eating, after getting dressed, etc. If you "stack habits" it's easy to follow them.
