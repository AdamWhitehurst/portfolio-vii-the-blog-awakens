# Hypothesis

Satoshi Nakamoto is the author of [Bitcoin's whitepaper](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09959.html) and wrote its [original source code](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/code/). However, Satoshi Nakamoto is presumed to be a pseudonym as no one by this name can be found. The are many clues that point towards Satoshi Nakamoto actually being [Adam Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back):

    1. He was a cryptopunk, so he was familiar with the practice of using pseudonyms.

    2. He was the first one Satoshi contacted on the [metzdowd cryptography list](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/index.html).
    3. He wrote [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash), which is used in the Bitcoin mining process.
    4. He was school in the UK during the time where [Forth](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)>) was commonly taught. Bitcoin's scripting language, Script, is [Forth](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)>)-like.

# Testing

Using [[code_stylometry]], one could test this by comparing [the original bitcoin source code](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/code/) to a training set of all open source software Using [[code_stylometry]]. Another approach would be to do a correllation analysis between bitcoin source and any code written by Adam Back, but that depends on whether such code is available.

# Get Over It

Only problem is, Adam Back has already denied these claims, and for good reason: "Itâ€™s generally viewed at this point as better that the founder of Bitcoin is not known" [(src)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfcvX0P1b5g)
