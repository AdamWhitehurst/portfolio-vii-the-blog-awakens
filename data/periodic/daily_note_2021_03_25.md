## Journal

Yesterday was not the _best_ start, but it was a start at the very least. Today I just keep at it. Check those things off and keep moving.

I'm mostly disappointed that I let myself get so distracted. I mean, I absolutely forgot about my blood test! Aww jeez. Moreover, I did nothing productive. When that happens, I just feel trapped. I like to be productive, but when I feel trapped my motivation slumps, which less to even less productivity.

On the bright side, I found time to take a walk, and I need more sun so that's good. Typing that reminded me to pause and check my body (Headspace thing). I did at least start looking at JWC's CSS course and learned that you should use px units rather than rem units for spacing and I actually went through my portfolio and made all those changes! So that was nice. It was not even that hard, I just let myself get distracted.

Going forward, if I simply give up because the first day of my system didn't go so well, then I have failed. If I keep at it, and try to improve, then I simply won't fail. 😊 Yesterday was not a failure, but a learning opportunity, and what did I learn?

- I get distracted easily
- Make tasks more [[smart_goals|SMART]]
- I need to set reminders
- Try timeblocking maybe?

I will ponder this and find other things as well.
