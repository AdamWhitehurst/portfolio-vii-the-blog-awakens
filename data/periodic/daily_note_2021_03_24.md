## Journal

This is the first day of journalling in my new system. I am excited about the planned system I have, it's only a matter of execution at this point. I must remember to push my latest changes before leaving on Sunday, so that I have all my latest tasks, etc.

What I hope to accomplish with this system is to be more organized about my projects and to be able to track important things in my life.

My current daily and weekly notes are only the beginning. I have yet to fill out the weekly template as I'm not sure what I should put into it. 

I think that reflection on the past week would be a good idea. That way I can remember the things for which I am grateful, can improve upon, have accomplished and of which I am proud.

More importantly, I want to keep my system *lean.* I have tried a few systems in Notion but they all seemed bloated with extra steps I did not find absolutely useful. For this Obsidian system, I want it to be wholly my own and I do not want to copy anyone else's system. I will, of course, take ideas from others.

I have only just realized I should have some sort of time limit on my journalling since, at this point, I have no idea how long I have been journalling nor do I know where to stop.

Upon that, I will ponder. But for now, I will conclude this first day of journalling short. Start small, keep building. Farewell for now ðŸ˜€

## August Bradley Notes
### Priority Task List
Have a priority list that focuses on the single day (my daily note)
- So you are not distracted by later-in-the-week tasks
- Plan it the night before so you never think "Oh what do I start on today?" This is a dangerous thought

### Action Zone
- Prioritizing tasks
	- Stratify into 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th priority
	- Accomplishing the top two priorities is a successful day
	- Make daily task list DOABLE, that way you can push to finish and be satisfied. Allowing rollover tasks is dangerous and leads to more slippage.

## Today I Learned
- Use px instead of rem for padding and margin
